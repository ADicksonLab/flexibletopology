* Flexible Topology
This project aims to develop a tool to dynamically design potential
drug molecules. The ~Flexible Topology~ method uses [[https://pytorch.org][PyTorch]] to build a
ML model, which can be trainable or non-trainable. It will then
predict the structure and pose of a set of given ~ghost atoms~ to be a
potential ligand candidate for a protein. The output of the model is a
function whose gradient, with respect to positions, produces external
forces. These force will constally change the chemical type and
positions of ghost atoms and optimize them toward target drug-like
molecules.

We run molecular dynamics simulations using [[https://github.com/pandegroup/openmm][Openmm]] where the OpenMM
Plugin [[https://github.com/ADicksonLab/mlforce.git][MLForce]] is employed to apply the ML-based forces.
